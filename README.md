## Notes
- `SWBF II Cinematic Tools.exe` is a decompiled and recompiled version of the one originally given out, which will inject `CT_SWBF2.patched.dll` instead of without the '.patched' part.
- `Updater.exe` is also a decompiled version of the updater originally released but changed to work with this new system
- Release versions will only ship with files:
  - CT_SWBF2.patched.dll
  - SWBF II Cinematic Tools.exe
  - Updater.exe
  - controls.tx
